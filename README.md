Basic game with resource management and strategy.

I intend to develop this longer term to expand skills and see how much complexity I can bring to it.

Current features:
-Randomly generated terrain: Grassland, stone, forrest.
-Entities with pathfinding: Human NPCs (Worker, Warrior), Animal NPCs (Bear)

Intended Changes:
-Increased terrain complexity
-Weather/event systems
-NPC stats, more entity types
